This is a Desktop application that is made for my personal use, to build my app development skills in the Python Stack. I chose PyQt as the library to code the application. 
This application is an enhanced version of the ToDo app, which concentrates on the spiritual duties and the material duties too in a smart way by showing results in the leaderboard for every person who joins the app and also the skills required to manage time especially for the people who stay in VOICE( Vedic Oasis of Instituation Culture and Wisdom).

This application further enhances the usage of the user by showing the graphical and visual statistics for the respective user. Having a decent security, the application maintains privacy and the security of the user carefully.
